git
===
An scm tool that works with git.


Configuration Options
---------------------
- :code:`git.uri` - (**Required**) The URI of the upstream repository to clone.
- :code:`git.revision` - A reference to a tree for dev-pipeline to check out.
  This will be passed directly to a :code:`git checkout` command, so you can be
  flexible with this option.  In practice, tags and branches are probably most
  useful.
